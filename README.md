# starter-monorepo

## Get started

Just click the `Use this template` button.

After using the template to create your blank project, the [Cleanup Template workflow](./.github/workflows/cleanup.yml) will be triggered to override or remove any template-specific configurations, such as the repo name, username, etc.

> **Notice**
>
> If you can still **see this message in your generated repo**, it means the **cleanup has not been done** properly, and just wait for it.
